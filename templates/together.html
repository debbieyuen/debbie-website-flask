 <!-- <p> 
   I grew up with Kathy, my older sister with severe autism, and am involved in several nonprofit organizations that support people with developmental disabilities and their families. I was inspired to create project Together after hearing my family members and friends voice for more emotional support. Seeing the way ABA therapists, special education teachers, and caretakers document data and communicate with each other, the process can become complicated, isolating, and time-consuming. I believe that tools that give care teams (parents, caregivers, therapists, etc.) more time to focus on the individual caring for and their own mental and physical health are necessary. Together is specifically designed with my family to address these needs by connecting an individual’s care team together and simplifying the data collection process. 
 </p> 
 <p>Individuals diagnosed with severe autism may include 24/7 care and supervision. Those who care for people with disabilities need the ability to focus more on caring for the individual and less time writing and documenting data. They also would benefit from receiving a more uniform understanding of the wellbeing of the person with severe autism. When there are many tasks and responsibilities to juggle, it is important that no one feels alone amongst the care providing network. </p>
<p>While ABA data collection software and mobile scheduling applications for people with autism exist, I am exploring intuitive wearables that can document information quickly without reaching for a phone or notebook. It is important that caretakers have the option to keep their handsfree. Why not Apple’s iWatch? The iWatch would make it harder to press and feel buttons without looking at the screen. It is also cannot be conveniently passed from user to user. </p>
<p>How might I design a wearable that can better connect individuals with severe autism and those part of their care team? </p> -->
